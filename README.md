Part I:
Install the following extensions in VS Code:

"Extension Pack for Java"
"Debugger for Java"
Next...

Find the absolute path to the "mvn" of the file "apache-maven" (I found its path from searching my C drive for "apache-maven") ex: Screenshot 2023-11-16 183612

Ctrl + Shift + P and type "preferences open user settings"

Add a new independent path making sure to exclude it from any other programs already in the file:

"maven.executable.path": "absolute path from step 1 here"
Save file, exit, reopen VS Code

Ctrl + F5 making sure program runs and exe path was found
